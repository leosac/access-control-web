In the app file, you can declare your models (and adapters), instance-initializers, serializers and transforms.

There may be more, but this is not tested yet.

There is nothing in ember-engine that allow us to share models, but if you share the store from the application,
you will have access to the models from the application, because they are in the store.
This is useful if you need to set a relationships.

An other important point is the translations specific to the engines. In order to use the translations from the
application, and to avoid duplicate, you have to share the i18n service from the application,
and then add the translation in an instance-initializer like in the blueprint.
